### An engine built on Vulkan and SDL!

Working with Vulkan and SDL! - Current stage: following online tutorials until I get the hang of things

[Here's the tutorial I'm following](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9U9IE0gVHA&list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR)

Code includes some comments about the differences in SDL2 and glfw when it comes to following the tutorial as well.

<!-- Todo: Implement shields.io on here to show build status, version, etc-->
